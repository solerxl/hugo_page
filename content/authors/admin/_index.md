I am a final-year master's student at Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU) advised by Prof. [Feiping Nie](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2oB4nAIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Previously, I received my B.Eng. degree from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NJUPT) under the supervision of Prof. [Lei Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n8WF5kEAAAAJ).
My research interests focus on dimensionality reduction, including feature selection and clustering. I am also interested in the graph machine learning and the interpretability of machine learning.

<font color="red"> <i>I am actively looking for a PhD position in Fall, 2024. I'm open to any meaningful research topics during my doctoral studies.</i> </font>
