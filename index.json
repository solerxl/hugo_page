In this paper, we propose a deep FS method that simultaneously conducts feature selection and differentiable $k$-NN graph learning based on the Dirichlet Energy. The Dirichlet Energy identifies important features by measuring their smoothness on the graph structure, and facilitates the learning of a new graph that reflects the inherent structure in new feature subspace. We employ Optimal Transport theory to address the non-differentiability issue of learning $k$-NN graphs in neural networks, which theoretically makes our method applicable to other graph neural networks for dynamic graph learning. Furthermore, the proposed framework is interpretable, since all modules are designed algorithmically. We validate the effectiveness of our model with extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.\n","date":1695340800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1695340800,"objectID":"1ef2b9b712c80b7f322c89ba95b26a0c","permalink":"https://solerxl.github.io/project/neurips2023/","publishdate":"2023-09-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/neurips2023/","section":"project","summary":"Proc.

In this study, we focus on the l2,0-norm based feature selection, which is effective for exact top-k feature selection but challenging to optimize. To solve the general l2,0-norm constrained problems, we novelly develop a parameter-free optimization framework based on the coordinate descend (CD) method, termed CD-LSR. Specifically, we devise a skillful conversion from the original problem to solving one continuous matrix and one discrete selection matrix. Then the nontrivial l2,0-norm constraint can be solved efficiently by solving the selection matrix with CD method. We impose the l2,0-norm on a vanilla least square regression (LSR) model for feature selection and optimize it with CD-LSR. Extensive experiments exhibit the efficiency of CD-LSR, as well as the discrimination ability of l2,0-norm to identify informative features. More importantly, the versatility of CD-LSR facilitates the applications of the l2,0-norm in more sophisticated models. Based on the competitive performance of l2,0-norm on the baseline LSR model, the satisfactory performance of its applications is reasonably expected.

Predicting AD progression will clinically help improve diagnosis and empower sufferers in taking proactive care. However, most existing methods only target individuals with a fixed number of historical visits, and only predict the cognitive scores once at a fixed time horizon in the future, which cannot meet practical requirements. In this study, we consider a flexible yet more challenging scenario in which individuals may suffer from the (arbitrary) modality-missing issue, as well as the number of individuals’ historical visits and the length of target score trajectories being not prespecified. To address this problem, a multi-modal sequence learning framework, highlighted by deep latent representation collaborated sequence learning strategy, is proposed to flexibly handle the incomplete variable-length longitudinal multi-modal data. Specifically, the proposed framework first employs a deep multi-modality fusion module that automatically captures complementary information for each individual with incomplete multi-modality data. A comprehensive representation is thus learned and fed into a sequence learning module to model AD progression. In addition, both the multi-modality fusion module and sequence learning module are collaboratively trained to further promote the performance of AD progression prediction. Experimental results on Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset validate the superiority of our method.\n","date":1661126400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661126400,"objectID":"47b6f4db0e28322f42ecc49cbc975316","permalink":"https://solerxl.github.io/project/media2022/","publishdate":"2022-08-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/media2022/","section":"project","summary":" Medical Image Analysis, **Lei Xu**, Lei Chen, Rong Wang, Feiping Nie, Xuelong Li.","tags":["Journal","Alzhermer's Disease"],"title":"Multi-modal sequence learning for Alzheimer’s disease progression prediction with incomplete variable-length longitudinal data","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract Feature selection is widely used in multimedia applications to determine informative features from high-dimensional data.
